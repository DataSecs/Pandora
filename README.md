## Description

Pandora is a simple search engine that is powered by [Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/apache/cassandra)
and [Hydra](https://github.com/marcluque/Hydra) (a network framework).
It simply maps a keyword onto a list of links in order to store everything in a database and would just retrieve all
the found links for a keyword, or even several keywords. The implementation might be a bit outdated.
